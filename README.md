Development of the optimization model for minimum variance of importance measures across multiple commodities in the Swedish railway.

A Swedish Rail network’s reliability should be improved by balancing importance measures related to link capacity between rail network nodes. A proposed multi-objective balancing optimization method developed by Zio and Podofillini is to be applied to a multicommodity a rail network. Without proper balancing of the network, a disruption, such as heavy snowfall or landslides, could result in the people relying on the rail network losing access to essential commodities. Thus, the purpose of this model is to extend a multi-objective optimization model of multiple commodities that includes a balancing of component importance for minimal importance measure variance between links.

The problem of unbalanced components can be addressed by adding a balancing objective in the optimization problem. Zio & Podofillini (2006) proposed a balancing optimization model in which the differences in the values of an importance measure are minimized to avoid bottlenecks and over-performing components. This approach has been paired with genetic algorithms to rank the fitness of design systems for nuclear plants (Zio & Podofillini (2007); Podofillini & Zio (2008)). Podofillini & Zio (2008) investigated the suitability of three different importance measures in a test/maintenance optimization problem. However, the approach has yet to be applied in ranking flow-based network importance using multiple importance measures, nor over multiple commodities.
